    <p class="top">A lot of my biggest passions have to do with music. I love collecting vinyl records (End of an Ear's my store), and I like going to concerts as much as humanly possible. I also cooking, and the more 'from scratch', the better! I like making homemade pasta and pizza. I currently work at a software company called Social Solutions, where I design databases for customers within our two software applications. I enjoy working in the nonprofit space, and talking to customers who serve such a nececssary calling. </p>
